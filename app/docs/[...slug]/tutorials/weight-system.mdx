# Weight System

Weights are the most fundamental concept in the economics of Commune. Stake collectively weights the distribution of rewards. Validator Stake submits weights periodically representing the proportion of rewards each Miner should have according to their evaluation of them. This allows to granularly define and adapt the distribution of rewards between miners, while seperating the computation involved in calculating the weights from the protocol. Allowing to create granular, adaptive, dynamic incentive landscapes.

Since this basic mechanism alone is vulnerable to selfish dishonest actors, subnets run a consensus calculation between the transformation of local weights to global weights based on Stake.
