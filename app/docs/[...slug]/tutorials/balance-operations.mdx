# Balance Operations

## Transferring Balance

You can transfer balance from one key to another

```bash
comx balance transfer <key-name> <amount> <receiver-ss58address>
```

Or, if the receivers key is located on your disk

```bash
comx balance transfer <key-name> <amount> <key-name>
```

## Staking Balance

When staking a balance, you first have to pick a subnet id (netuid) and destination validator.

The staking command is defined as follows

```bash
comx balance stake <key-name> <amount> <validator-ss58address> [--netuid <number>]
```

Similar to transferring if the validator key is already located on your disk you can use.

```bash
comx balance stake <key-name> <amount> <validator-name> [--netuid <number>]
```

## Unstaking Balance

When unstaking a balance, you need to specify the subnet id (netuid) and the amount you wish to unstake.

The unstaking command is defined as follows:

```bash
comx balance unstake <key-name> <amount> <validator-ss58address> [--netuid <number>]
```

You can also specify the name of the key, if it's located on your disk. Same as in transferring or staking.
