# Governance

Commune AI governance is a system based on the principles of decentralization, transparency, and community-driven decision-making. It is designed to ensure that the Commune network remains secure, efficient, and adaptable to the evolving needs of its users.

### Key Components of Commune Governance

#### 1. **Decentralized Governance Model**

Commune's governance model is decentralized, meaning that decisions are made by a distributed network of stakeholders rather than a centralized authority. This approach ensures that no single entity has undue influence over the network's direction or operation.

#### 2. **Community Proposals**

Community members can submit proposals for changes to the Commune network, such as protocol upgrades, parameter adjustments, or funding requests. These proposals are subject to a voting process, where token holders can approve or reject them based on their merits.

You can view and vote on proposals on the [Community Proposals](https://governance.communeai.org/) website.

#### 3. **Voting Mechanism**

Commune's voting mechanism allows stake holders to cast votes on community proposals, with each stake holder's voting power proportional to the number of tokens they hold. This system ensures that decisions are made by those who have a vested interest in the network's success.

#### 4. **Rewards**

Stake holders who actively participate in the community proposals process may be eligible to receive rewards. These rewards are distributed to incentivize community engagement and encourage stakeholders to contribute to the network's long-term success.

### How to Participate in Community Proposals

#### 1. **Acquire Tokens**

To participate in a proposal, you need to acquire tokens through staking, purchasing, or earning them through network activities. These tokens represent your voting power and influence within the governance system.

#### 2. **Review Community Proposals**

Visit the [Community Proposals](https://governance.communeai.org/) website to view the latest proposals submitted by community members. Each proposal contains details about the proposed change, its rationale, and the potential impact on the network.

#### 3. **Cast Your Vote**

When a governance proposal is open for voting, use your governance tokens to cast your vote in favor of or against the proposal. Consider the potential impact of the proposal on the network and community, and vote accordingly to support the best interests of Commune.

#### 4. **Monitor Voting Results**

After the voting period ends, monitor the results to see whether the proposal was approved or rejected by the community. This outcome will determine the next steps for implementing the proposed change or addressing community concerns.
