# Yuma Consensus

Yuma Consensus, the core invention of Bittensor, is a widely applicable mechanism for neutralizing manipulation attempts from minority groups in a dynamically stable honest majority equilibrium. 

It is a fuzzy consensus to determine a stable agreement in a network full of divergent opinions, using purely stake and the weights submitted by stake.

The consensus weight is calculated by determining the highest weight supported by at least the stake majority, meaning the majority has submitted either equal or higher weight. 

This is calculated using a weighted stake-based median over the cumulative stake-weight distribution.

After the consensus weight is determined, there are 2 core mechanisms for neutralizing and penalizing manipulation attempts.

1. clipping all excess weights set above the consensus weight down to the consensus weight.  (weights set below the consensus weight are ignored)
note: weights set below the consensus weight are ignored in the nature of the median calculation

2. slashing the bonds of Stake weight set above the consensus weight 
note: setting weights below the consensus weigh means a lower bond in a higher value miner, in its nature leading to dividend penalty. However, higher bonds have to be corrected.
