# Participating on a subnet

[Learn what a subnet is](/docs/subnets/what-is-a-subnet)

Subnets have 3 classes of actors
- Subnet [Founder](/docs/subnets/building-a-subnet)
- Subnet [Validators](/docs/validating/what-is-validating)
- Subnet [Miners](/docs/mining/what-is-mining) 

If you are a holder and want to access or support a subnet with your stake, start a validator or delegate your stake to a validator active on the subnet.

If you want to mine on a subnet, look into their github repository and resources provided by the subnet team to get an idea of what is required.

If you want to build a subnet, read [this](/docs/subnets/building-a-subnet) and familiarize yourself with [Yuma Consensus](/docs/subspace/yuma-consensus)
