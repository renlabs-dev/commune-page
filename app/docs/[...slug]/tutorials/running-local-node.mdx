# Running a Commune Node

#### Running with Docker

1. **Docker Installed**: Ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

#### Running from Source

1. **Git Installed**: You'll need Git to clone the repository. Download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/).
2. **Rust Installed**: The Rust programming language is required for building the source code. Install it from [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Running the Substrate Node with Docker

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Run the Docker Command**:
   ```sh
   docker run --rm -ti ghcr.io/agicommies/subspace:ad75e7d node-subspace --chain main --sync warp
   ```
   This command will:
   - `docker run` starts a new Docker container.
   - `--rm` ensures the container is removed after it stops.
   - `-ti` allocates a pseudo-TTY and keeps the container interactive.
   - `ghcr.io/agicommies/subspace:ad75e7d` specifies the Docker image to use.
   - `node-subspace --chain main --sync warp` runs the Subspace node with the specified options.

2. **Verify the Node is Running**:
   - You should see output in the terminal indicating the node is starting. If there are any errors, make sure Docker is correctly installed and try running the command again.

#### Viewing Package Versions

You can view all package versions for the Docker image at the following link:

### Running the Substrate Node from Source

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Open a terminal and run:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/commune-ai/subspace
     ```
   - This command will clone the Subspace repository to your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Change to the cloned directory:
     ```sh
     cd subspace
     ```

3. **Install Rust** (if not already installed):
   - Run the following command to install Rust:
     ```sh
     curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation. You may need to restart your terminal or run `source $HOME/.cargo/env` to update your environment.

4. **Compile the Latest Release**:
   - Ensure you're in the `subspace` directory, then run:
     ```sh
     cargo build --release
     ```
   - This command will compile the Subspace node. It may take some time, depending on your computer's performance.

5. **Start the Node**:
   - Once the compilation is complete, start the node with:
     ```sh
     ./target/release/node-subspace --chain main --sync warp
     ```
   - You should see output indicating the node is starting. If there are any errors, ensure Rust and its dependencies are correctly installed and try running the command again.
