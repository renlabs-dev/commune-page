# Running Validator Basics

## Description

Running a validator consists of setting **weights** on miners. Once every **tempo**, rewards are distributed based on the score of modules.
You can use the **vote** method of **CommuneClient**, which you can import from **communex.client** to set weights. 
Please note that every subnet has its own **min_allowed_weights** and **max_allowed_weights** and you should respect this parameters when casting votes

This being said, how you're going to evaluate each module to decide it's weights is up to you. The general idea is to query the addresses of every
module on the subnet, call their respective andpoints and run a scoring function against their answers.
