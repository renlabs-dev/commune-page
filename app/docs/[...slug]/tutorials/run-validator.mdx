# Running Validator Basics

## Description

Running a validator consists of setting **weights** on miners. Once every **tempo**, rewards are distributed based on the score of modules.
You can use the [vote](https://docs.communex.ai/communex/client#CommuneClient.vote) method to set weights. 
Please note that every subnet has its own **min_allowed_weights** and **max_allowed_weights** and you should respect those parameters when casting votes

The general idea is to query the addresses of every module on the subnet, 
call their respective endpoints, run a scoring function, in accord to your subnet validation mechanism, against their answers and set weights. 

For a more concrete example, you can take a look at this [sketch of a validator](https://github.com/agicommies/commune-subnet-template/blob/main/src/subnet/validator/validator.py)
