# Create Validator

## With communex

You can use the [communex.module.client.ModuleClient](https://docs.communex.ai/communex/module/client#ModuleClient) to request miners.
You can then score their answers according to the validation mechanism of the subnet
and use [communex.client.vote](https://docs.communex.ai/communex/client#CommuneClient.vote) to cast a vote and set weights into it. 

Note that each subnet specifies a set of
parameters that can change what is considered a valid vote or not. If you need to consult the parameters of the specific
subnet in which you want to run your validator, you can use the command:
```sh
comx subnet info <netuid>
```

## On your own

If you want to implement your own client, the specifications are described on [Module Connect](/docs/modules/module-connect)
