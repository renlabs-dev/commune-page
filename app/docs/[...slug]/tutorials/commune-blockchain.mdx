# Subspace The Commune Blockchain

Commune's blockchain **Subspace**, is built on top of the [Rust Substrate](https://docs-substrate-io.translate.goog/learn/rust-basics/?_x_tr_sl=en&_x_tr_tl=cs&_x_tr_hl=cs&_x_tr_pto=sc) framework.

## Overview

Subspace is built using [Substrate](https://substrate.io/), a framework for developing scalable and upgradeable blockchains. It provides the core functionality and security needed for Commune's platform:

1. Implements Commune's consensus mechanism
2. Advertises cluster modules and their IP addresses
3. Enables peer discovery for nodes to connect with each other

## Installation

1. Complete the [basic Rust setup instructions](https://github.com/agicommies/subspace-network/blob/main/docs/rust-setup.md).

2. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/commune-network/subspace.git
cd subspace/
```

## Usage

### Build

To build the node without launching it, run:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

### Run

To run a single development node with ephemeral storage:

```bash
./target/release/node-subspace --dev
```

This will start a Subspace node with a clean state. The node's state will be discarded on exit.

To retain the node's state between runs, specify a base path:

```bash
mkdir my-chain-state/
./target/release/node-subspace --dev --base-path ./my-chain-state/
```

Other useful commands:

```bash
# Purge chain state
./target/release/node-subspace purge-chain --dev

# Detailed logging
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 ./target/release/subspace-ldebug --dev

# Explore parameters and subcommands
./target/release/node-subspace -h
```

### Test

To run all tests:

```bash
cargo test --all
```

To run specific tests:

```bash
cargo test -p pallet-subspace --test test_voting
```

To run tests with detailed logs:

```bash
SKIP_WASM_BUILD=1 RUST_LOG=runtime=debug cargo test -- --nocapture
```

## Architecture

Subspace leverages the modular and extensible architecture of Substrate. It uses FRAME pallets to encapsulate domain-specific logic such as consensus, storage, and p2p networking.

Notable components:

- **/node**: Implementation of the Subspace node including networking, consensus, and RPC
- **/runtime**: The core blockchain logic responsible for validating and executing state transitions
- **/pallets**: Custom FRAME pallets with Commune-specific logic
