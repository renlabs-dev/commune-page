# Testnet

Communai Ai provides a [public testnet](https://telemetry.testnet.communeai.net/#/0xcca1c66f7fad272c5687e5c0838b043e60a7677232782b5a2c9ecab7b2bfe95a)

## Connecting To Testnet Nodes

If you want to perform any onchain operation on a testnet, with CLI, simply pass the **--testnet** flag 

Structure usage

```bash
comx --testnet [SUBCOMMAND] COMMAND [ARGS] 
```

For example, list your balances on a testnet by

```bash
comx --testnet key balances
```

### Faucet 

The faucet functionality is planned, and will soon be introduced as a POW token generation method for the testnet.
