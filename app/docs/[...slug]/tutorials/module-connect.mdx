# Module Connect

## Through ModuleClient

To connect to a miner using CommuneX, you can simply use the **ModuleClient** class. It would look like this:

```py
    client = ModuleClient("localhost", 8000, keypair)
    result = asyncio.run(client.call("do_the_thing", target_key, {"awesomeness": 45, "extra": "hi"}))
```

- **keypair** is the keypair you're going to use on your client. 
Miners only accept connections from clients with a key registered on the Commune network, and on the **same subnet** (netuid) as them. 
- **target_key** is the **ss58address** of the miner you're going to connect to.

## On Your Own
If you don't want to use python to make your requests, you can implement your own client as you wish, but some
particularities needs to be followed:

- Your request should be a json with the fields **params**, **timestamp** and **target_key**.
- You should include **X-Key**, **X-Crypto** and **X-Signature** on the headers.
  
**timestamp** is the ISO timestamp of your request, **target_key** is the ss58address of the miner that your request is directed at.
**params** is the actual data that the miner expects on the endpoint. This json should be signed to create a SR25519 signature that
You're going to put on the **X-Signature** header. **X-Crypto** is the type of cryptography of your key (currently only SR25519 is supported) and
**X-Key** is the hexstring of your public key.
