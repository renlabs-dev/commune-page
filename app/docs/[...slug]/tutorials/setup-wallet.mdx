# Setting Up a Wallet

You can set up a wallet in various ways, depending on the blockchain network you are using and your preferences. This tutorial will guide you through setting up a wallet using the SubWallet extension, a popular non-custodial wallet for managing assets across multiple blockchains.

#### Step 1: Install the SubWallet Extension

1. **Download the Extension**: Visit the [SubWallet download page](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html) and choose the appropriate extension for your browser (Chrome, Brave, Firefox, or Microsoft Edge).
2. **Add to Browser**: Click on the download link and follow the prompts to add the SubWallet extension to your browser.

#### Step 2: Create a New Wallet

1. **Open SubWallet**: Click on the SubWallet icon in your browserâ€™s extension area to open the wallet.
2. **Create a Master Password**: You will be prompted to create a master password. This password is crucial as it encrypts your wallet data on your device for security.
3. **Backup Your Seed Phrase**: After setting your password, you will receive a seed phrase. Write this down and store it in a secure location. This seed phrase is essential for recovering your wallet if you forget your password or lose access to your device.

#### Step 3: Account Management

1. **Create or Import Accounts**: You can create a new account or import an existing one using the seed phrase. To create a new account, simply follow the prompts after initializing your wallet.
2. **Manage Multiple Accounts**: SubWallet allows you to manage multiple accounts. You can switch between them, rename them, or manage their details as needed.

#### Step 4: Connect to DApps

1. **Connect to Commune**: Just click on the Connect Wallet button on the Commune website and select SubWallet from the list of available wallets.
2. **Manage DApp Connections**: You can manage and review your DApp connections directly from the wallet interface.

#### Additional Features

- **Staking**: SubWallet supports staking on networks like Polkadot and Kusama. You can start staking, manage nominations, and claim rewards directly from your wallet.
- **Security Features**: SubWallet is non-custodial, meaning you control your keys. It also supports hardware wallets like Ledger and Keystone for enhanced security.

#### Support and Resources
