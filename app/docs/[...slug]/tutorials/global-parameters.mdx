# Global Parameters

Global Parameters apply across the whole protocol and all subnets. They allow to configure the protocols constraints to optimize its functioning. If problems appear, a parameter change might suffice to mitigate them. New parameters can be introduced.

Global Parameter changes require a proposal to pass through the [DAO governance process](/docs/concepts/governance).

## Fields

- **max_allowed_subnets**: The maximum number of subnets allowed in the blockchain. This limits the total number of subnets that can exist at once.

- **max_allowed_modules**: The maximum number of modules allowed per subnet. It sets an upper limit on the number of modules that can be added globally to the network.

- **max_registrations_per_block**: The maximum number of registrations allowed per block. This parameter controls the number of registrations that can be processed in a single block.

- **target_registrations_interval**: The number of blocks that defines the registration interval. It determines the interval at which registrations are targeted to occur, it's essential part of the registration burn calculation.

- **target_registrations_per_interval**: The desired number of registrations per interval. This parameter sets the target number of registrations to be processed within each registration interval. Also essential part of the registration burn calculation.

- **unit_emission**: The emission per block. It specifies the amount of new tokens emitted in each block.

- **max_name_length**: The maximum length allowed for a network name. It sets an upper limit on the number of characters that can be used in a network name (module or subnet).

- **min_name_length**: The minimum length allowed for a network name. It sets a lower limit on the number of characters that can be used in a network name (subnet / module).

- **burn_rate**: The rate at which tokens are burned. It determines the percentage or amount of tokens that are permanently removed from circulation.

- **min_burn**: The minimum burn required. It sets the minimum amount of tokens that need to be burned for a registration.

- **max_burn**: The maximum burn allowed. It sets an upper limit on the amount of tokens that can be burned for a registration.

- **min_stake**: The minimum stake required. It specifies the minimum amount of tokens that need to be staked on a module when registering.

- **min_weight_stake**: The minimum stake per weight required.

- **adjustment_alpha**: The adjustment alpha parameter. Used in the steepness of registration burn calculation.

- **floor_delegation_fee**: The minimum delegation fee. It sets the lowest percentage that can be charged as a fee for delegating tokens.

- **max_allowed_weights**: The maximum number of weights allowed weights that validator can set.

- **curator**: The account ID / multisig ID of the curator in general subnet DAO.

- **proposal_cost**: The cost of creating a proposal. It sets the amount of tokens required to submit a proposal, returned when the proposal passes.

- **proposal_expiration**: The expiration time for proposals. It determines the duration after which a proposal is considered expired.

- **proposal_participation_threshold**: The minimum participation threshold for proposals. It sets the required percentage or number of participants needed for a proposal to be considered valid.

- **subnet_stake_threshold**: The stake threshold for subnets. It specifies the minimum % amount of all staked tokens, that need to be staked on a subnet to produce emission.
