# Yuma Subnets

Subnets that run on Yuma Consensus, giving them a set of characteristics important to understand for participants. See [Yuma Consensus](/docs/subspace/yuma-consensus)

Every subnet except the general subnet 0 is a yuma subnet. 

The active stake on yuma subnets has to exceed the SubnetStakeThreshold level to start producing emissions. This is because Consensus only is as strong as the amount of Stake active within a subnet.
