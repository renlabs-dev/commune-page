# Create a Miner

## With communex

To create a miner and provide value to the network, you can make a class that inherits from the ModuleServer class
and decorate the functions you want to provide as endpoints with **endpoint**. Example:

```python
class Amod(Module):
    @endpoint
    def do_the_thing(self, awesomeness: int = 42):
        if awesomeness > 60:
            msg = f"You're super awesome: {awesomeness} awesomeness"
        else:
            msg = f"You're not that awesome: {awesomeness} awesomeness"
        return {"msg": msg}
```

This defines a module that can be served with the command **comx module serve**.

## On your own

You can just create and serve a HTTP api as you prefer. Just make sure that all your schemas look like:

```json
"timestamp": <ISO-timestamp>
"target-key": <str> // <- (this represents the ss58address of your miner)
"params": <Any> // <- This is whatever data you would actually want to receive on your endpoint
```

Beyond this, requests made with our ModuleClient will send you the following headers:

```json
"X-Signature": <hexstring> // This is the hexstring of the sr25519 signature of the data described above
"X-Key": <hexstring> // The public key that signed the data
"X-Crypto": <int> // Maps which crypto scheme is being used. Currently, we only use sr25519

```
