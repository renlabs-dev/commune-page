# Bonds

Stake setting weights on miners is bonding to them. Bonds are Stake-weight proportional ownership over the share of emissions accrued by the miner, paid out as dividends every epoch. 

The concept of the bond, as an intermediary between Stake-weight and rewards, allows to modulate the incentives of validators. This is a vital component to Yuma Consensus, ensuring the robustness of the honest majority equilibrium.

Bonds consist of 2 parts:

instant bonds
- mirror validator weights
- base for EMA bonds
- no direct rewards

\Delta B_{ij} = S_i \cdot \vec{W}{ij} / \left(\sum_k S_k \cdot \vec{W}{kj}\right)

EMA bonds 
- calculated as exponential-moving-average over instant bonds, adjusted per time-step based on a=10% instant bond and 90% previous historic EMA bond
- pay dividends 

B_{ij}^{(t)} = \alpha \cdot \Delta B_{ij} + (1 - \alpha) \cdot B_{ij}^{(t-1)}

The EMA mitigates rapid changes and their exploitation potential, while rewarding discovery of miners.
