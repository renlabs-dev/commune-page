# Building a Subnet on the Commune Protocol

Subnets on the Commune protocol provide unique incentive environments that operate in parallel, each with its own set of characteristics defined by consensus, parameters, and validation methodology. Founders have control over the parameters and development of their subnets, except for subnet 0. Miners compete for subnet emissions, while subnets compete for protocol emissions.

To create a subnet, you'll need to define and implement several key components:

## Validator

The validator plays a crucial role in the subnet by validating the text generated by the miners. It retrieves module addresses from the subnet, prompts the miners to generate answers to a given question, and scores the generated answers against its own answers.

The validator includes functions for setting weights for miners based on their scores, cutting scores to the maximum allowed weights, extracting addresses from strings, retrieving the network UID of the subnet, and getting IP and port information from module addresses.

You can customize the validator's scoring logic, prompt generation, and other aspects to suit your subnet's specific requirements.

## Miner

The miner is responsible for mining and generating responses to prompts within the subnet. It receives prompts from the validator and generates responses using a specified model.

You can implement your own mining logic, choose the appropriate model for generating responses, and customize the miner's behavior based on your subnet's needs.

## Configuration

To set up your subnet, you'll need to configure various settings such as the maximum allowed weights for miners, the iteration interval for the validation loop, and other relevant parameters.

You can define these settings in a separate configuration file or module to keep your code organized and easily modifiable.

## Communication and Networking

The subnet components communicate with each other using the Commune protocol. The validator interacts with the miners by retrieving their addresses, sending prompts, and receiving generated responses.

You'll need to handle the communication between the validator and miners, including error handling, timeouts, and other network-related aspects.

## Customization and Extension

While the provided code template serves as a starting point, you should replace the placeholder logic with your own custom implementations. This includes the scoring logic in the validator, the response generation logic in the miner, and any other components that require customization.

You can extend the functionality of your subnet by adding additional features, implementing different consensus mechanisms, or integrating with external services or data sources.

## Deployment and Operation

To deploy your subnet, you'll need to set up the necessary infrastructure and configure the validator and miners to run on separate nodes or machines.

You can use tools like Docker or Kubernetes to containerize and orchestrate the deployment of your subnet components, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

Monitor the performance and health of your subnet, handle any errors or exceptions that may occur, and implement logging and debugging mechanisms to aid in troubleshooting.

## Conclusion

Building a subnet on the Commune protocol requires careful design, implementation, and customization of the validator, miner, and other components. By leveraging the provided code template and replacing the placeholder logic with your own custom implementations, you can create a unique and powerful incentive environment tailored to your specific needs.

Remember to handle communication, networking, and deployment aspects effectively to ensure the smooth operation of your subnet. With the right approach and customization, your subnet can compete for protocol emissions and attract miners to generate valuable outputs.
