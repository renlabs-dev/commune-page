# Key Basics

## Introduction

Managing keys is a fundamental aspect of using the **CommuneX** CLI. This section provides a comprehensive guide on how to create, retrieve, and manage keys within the system. Whether you're looking to generate a new key, view details of existing keys, or list all keys along with their balances, the following commands will facilitate these operations efficiently.

## Creating a Key

To create a new key, use the following command:

```sh
comx key create key_name
```

This command generates a new key with the specified name and stores it securely on disk.

## Import Wallet From pre-existing Mnemonic

To import a key from pre-existing mnemonic, use the following command:

```bash
comx key regen <my-wallet-name> <mnemonic>
```

## Retrieving Key Information

You can retrieve detailed information about a specific key by using:

```sh
comx key show key_name

For sensitive information, such as the private key, add the `--show-private` flag:

# Add the `--show-private` flag to show sensitive fields like private key.
comx key show key_name --show-private
```

This command displays both public and private key details, ensuring you have access to all necessary information securely.

## Listing Keys

To list all keys stored on your system, execute:

```sh
#Â Lists the names and addresses of keys stored on disk.
comx key list
```

This command provides a quick overview of the names and addresses of all keys saved on disk, allowing for easy management and access.

## Listing Keys with Balances

For a detailed view of the keys along with their respective balances, use:

```bash
# Lists keys stored on disk with their balance (free, staked and total).
comx key balances
```

This lists all keys along with their free, staked, and total balances, offering a comprehensive snapshot of your key's financial status.
You can also sort the balance by **all, free, staked** (default all summed balances).

For example

```bash
comx key balances --sort-balance free
```

Will return the keys sorted by their free balance
