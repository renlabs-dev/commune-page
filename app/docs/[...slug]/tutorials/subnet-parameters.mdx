# Subnet Parameters

Subnet parameters are local to each subnet and do not impact anything outside of it. They provide a set of tools for the subnet founder to configure its constraints to optimize its functioning.

## Fields

- **name**: The name of the subnet.

- **founder**: The account ID or address of the founder of the subnet.

- **founder_share**: The portion of subnet's emission allocated to the founder.

- **immunity_period**: The duration of the immunity period for the subnet. During this period, the subnet may have certain privileges or protections, such as being exempt from certain rules or penalties.

- **incentive_ratio**: The ratio of emission distribution between miners and validators.

- **max_allowed_uids**: The maximum number of unique identifiers (UIDs) allowed within the subnet.

- **max_allowed_weights**: The maximum number of weights allowed to be set by the subnet's validators.

- **min_allowed_weights**: The minimum number of weights allowed to be set by the subnet's validators.

- **min_stake**: The minimum stake required for participants in the subnet. It specifies the minimum amount of tokens that participants must stake or lock up to be eligible for participation or rewards.

- **tempo**: The tempo frequency at which the subnet emissions are being distributed.

- **vote_mode**: The vote mode determines whether the subnet operates in **authority**, only founder can make changes or **vote** parameter changes have to be done though a proposal [Governance](/docs/concepts/governance) process

- **max_weight_age**: The maximum lifespan of weights within the subnet. Weights pass the age won't count into the emission distribution.
