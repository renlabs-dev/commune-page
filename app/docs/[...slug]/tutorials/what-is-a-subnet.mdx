# What Is a Subnet

Subnets are distinct incentive environments running in parallel on the Commune protocol. Each is a unique environment based on a set of characterics defined by its consensus, parameters and validation methodology. 

Every subnet, except subnet 0, has a founder who has control over its parameters while driving its development.

Miners compete around subnet emissions, while subnets compete around protocol emissions.
