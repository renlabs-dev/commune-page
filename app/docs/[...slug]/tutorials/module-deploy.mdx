# Module deploy

Your module, be it a miner or a validator, is just a long lived process, so you can deploy it the same way you
would deploy anything else.

Options include:

- [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/reference/)
- Running your module as a daemon
- Any other method of running a process, really!
