# Module deploy

Your module, be it a miner or a validator, is just a long lived process, so you can deploy it the same way you
would deploy anything else.

Options include:

- (pm2)[https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/]
- (docker)[https://docs.docker.com/reference/]
- running your module as a daemon
- or any other method of running a process, really!
